      <h4>How Often Should You Go Camping?</h4>
      <p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to how often you should go camping. It largely depends on your personal schedule, lifestyle, and proximity to camping sites. However, making an effort to camp at least a few times a year can provide significant benefits. Whether it's a weekend getaway once every few months or a more ambitious goal of monthly trips, regular camping can help you recharge and reconnect with nature.</p>
      <h4>The Benefits of Camping</h4>
      <ol>
